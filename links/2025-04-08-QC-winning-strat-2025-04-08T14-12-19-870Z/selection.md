> How can Brands win on Q-com?
> 
> Every consumer brand founder/executive today is thinking about Quick Commerce. The growth is undeniable. The buzz is real. But very few brands are actually winning on Q-com. By winning I mean both growth and bottomline- at least CM2 positive
> 
> I have been asked this question many times by many folks. And although Atomberg isn’t that big in q-com yet relative to other channels ( in absolute terms it is in single digit crores monthly revenue) , but I have advised many founders who are doing well on q-com
> 
> So from that experience and some first principle thinking, here’s an honest playbook: What actually works, what doesn't, and how to think about Q-com in a way that drives incremental revenue, not just another P&L line cannibalizing another channel
> 
> First — Let’s Acknowledge the Context
> 
> Yes, Q-com is exploding. The consumer value prop is unbeatable: 15-minute delivery, deep discounting, gamified apps, and tons of visibility
> 
> But that doesn’t mean it’s plug-and-play for every brand. Q-com is not just another e-com channel. It's a fundamentally different consumer behavior — and you need a different strategy to win here.
> 
> Why Consumers Buy on Q-Com (and Why That Matters)
> 
> Here I speak as a consumer who uses q-com almost 10 times a week
> 
> Your product on Blinkit or Zepto or Swiggy is competing with 15 other brands…in a 2-second scroll window.
> 
> The consumer is:
> - Not reading your PDP copy
> - Not watching your ad
> - Not even seeing your full pack design
> 
> For most categories,
> 
> This is not a discovery-led channel like D2C
> This is not a search-led channel like Amazon
> This is not a recommendation-led channel like Retail
> 
> Q-com is a habit-led, impulse-led, shortcut-driven platform
> 
> And your brand's strategy has to reflect that
> 
> So, How Do You Win?
> 
> 1. Pack Size + Price Point Fit
> 
> If your product doesn’t match the mental price anchors of Q-com for a particular category(₹49, ₹99), you will struggle. Even if you are a premium brand
> 
> This is very similar to how GT operates. The reason most new age brands failed to crack GT is because they don’t have Rs 5 and Rs 10 and Rs 20 packs. The same holds true for q-com, albeit in different price anchors
> 
> What sells:
> 
> - Singles
> - Minis
> - Combos that feel like a deal (₹99 for 3)
> 
> For most brands and most categories, You’re selling convenience + impulse — not features
> 
> You’re in the business of frictionless indulgence
> 
> 2. Hero SKUs Only. No Range Play.
> 
> This is not the platform to push depth of catalogue. I have seen founders go out of their way to list more and more SKUs. It’s a death trap. In our case at Atomberg, I have done the opposite. The platforms wanted a bigger assortment but we looked at our sales data from across channels and suggested geography wise running models
> 
> Always Pick your top 2-3 highest velocity SKUs for that geography. Don’t list 20 products. Don’t confuse the algo.
> 
> Win velocity → win algorithm → win visibility → win more velocity. Flywheel only kicks in when you double down on what works.
> 
> 3. Your Pack Design = Your Ad Creative
> 
> On Blinkit, there is no ad copy. No A+ content.
> Your pack face is the ad. If it doesn’t stand out in thumbnail view, you’ve already lost.
> 
> Test your pack thumbnail at 100px resolution.
> If the variant, brand name, and benefit isn’t legible — go back to design.
> 
> Some brands are now designing Q-com-first packs. This will become a norm.
> 
> 4. Platform Schemes ≠ Brand Building
> 
> Yes, you’ll get “visibility slots” in exchange for margin burn
> 
> But unless you pair that with some brand demand generation, it’s just a spike
> 
> Run Q-com focused performance creatives on Meta/Google:
> 
> “Now on Blinkit/Zepto”
> “Delivered in 10 mins”
> 
> Problem-Solution formats that mention Q-com CTA
> 
> Use pin-code level attribution if possible. You’ll be shocked at the lift when demand gen meets immediate availability
> 
> We have done this with some success at Atomberg
> 
> 5. Focus on Availability and Visibility
> 
> Quick com mirrors GT in a lot of ways. Just like how availability and visibility is the key to success in GT, it is the same in Q-com. Obsessively track availability at a dark store level. And visibility at a city level.
> 
> My mental model has been to treat every dark store like an individual GT store. The right SKUs need to be available in right quantity and your brand must be visible whenever consumers are looking for the category
> 
> Metrics That Matter
> 
> Forget GMV. Focus on:
> 
> - Sell-through velocity (units per SKU per day per dark store)
> 
> - Weighted Availability
> 
> - Add-to-cart % vs category
> 
> - Repeat rate (ask your account manager)
> 
> - Share of Shelf ( which is nothing but SOV) vs Share of Sales
> 
> - Organic visibility % (i.e. how often you show up without a promo/paid ad)
> 
> These tell you whether you're building a business — or just renting a shelf
> 
> Q-com is seductive. Fast growth, fast movement, fast burn
> 
> But real success here doesn’t come from listing alone. And thinking like a consumer, not like a brand
> 
> If you’re in the right category (impulse, indulgence, top-up), and you pair smart merchandising with smart media —Q-com can be a serious growth engine
> 
> But if you approach it like D2C or modern trade or e-com, you’ll be 3 promos deep before you realize you’re not building anything sustainable
