# Scoop: 3 Ex-OpenAI Staffers Raise $20M For New Startup Applied Compute

### The pre-launch reinforcement learning startup founded by Rhythm Garg, Linden Li and Yash Patil, is now valued at $100 million -- and has received investment interest at 5x that price, sources say.

A new startup led by three young former technical staffers at OpenAI has raised pre-launch funding that values it at $100 million, Upstarts has learned.

Applied Compute, the new company founded by Rhythm Garg, Linden Li and Yash Patil, has raised $20 million in a funding round led by Benchmark partner Victor Lazarte, sources tell Upstarts.

Lazarte is joining the startup’s board as a result of the round, which is effectively a Series A in its size and scope. Sequoia also participated in the raise, alongside VC firms Conviction, Hanabi Capital and Definition, as well as solo capitalist Zach Frankel, the sources add.

Since the still-unannounced round came together, Applied Compute’s young founders – all three of whom are recent Stanford University students who worked on different technical projects within OpenAI – have already fielded interest from investors to pile on at valuations of $200 million and even $500 million valuations, two of the sources say.

Applied Compute’s founders and investors didn’t respond to comment requests, nor did OpenAI.

But through conversations with at least six sources, Upstarts can provide early insight into what their mysterious startup is building – as well as the identities of several of its early test users.

The startup is working in reinforcement learning (RL), a type of machine learning approach that rewards agents for learning the best path to achieve a desired outcome. This can prove especially useful in developing models that can reason, or solve more complex, long-term problems.

Last week, Upstarts interviewed the founders of AI unicorn poolside, which leans on RL for its programming models. OpenAI’s 01 model series, released in preview last September, uses RL to help it “think”, as the company [has described it](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1834278217626317026). That can come at a trade-off in cost and time compared to other models optimized simply to answer a fact-based query like you would use to cheat at trivia (don’t cheat at trivia, please).

All three of Applied Compute’s founders worked with reinforcement learning at OpenAI in some capacity, several sources say. Garg worked on reasoning efforts for the o1 model and high-compute RL efforts, per his LinkedIn. Li in machine learning systems, infrastructure and in improving accuracy, known as ‘correctness’, for more intensive, compute-heavy projects. Patil, meanwhile, worked on some of OpenAI’s early RL projects including the company’s first deep research demo, per his [posts on X](https://x.com/ypatil125/status/1923860871899644107).

Early test users of Applied Compute include Mercor, the AI recruiting startup that [I wrote in-depth about while still at](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/09/18/mercor-ai-interviewer-reaches-250-million-valuation/) *[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/09/18/mercor-ai-interviewer-reaches-250-million-valuation/)* last year, and which is now valued at $2 billion. Like Applied Compute, Mercor is backed by Lazarte at Benchmark, and is led by highly-technical young founders in their early 20s who dropped out of Harvard and Georgetown.

At Applied Compute, Li is the relative old hand, graduating from Stanford as far back as 2023, per his LinkedIn; Garg joined OpenAI while still a student that year and received his degree this past January, per LinkedIn and Stanford’s commencement materials; Patil took leave from Stanford to join OpenAI, also in 2023.

Another early test user is Cognition, the startup behind AI software engineering tool Devin. Cognition shares several investors with Applied Compute, including Conviction and Frankel.

Other startups are believed to be evaluating Applied Compute’s RL tools, sources say. One possible use case: to more efficiently fine-tune products to run in tailor-made fashion with the users’ own customers, working with their specific information.

Applied Compute isn’t the only startup, or even the only ex-OpenAI one, to be working in reinforcement learning. Former CTO Mira Murati’s unlaunched company, Thinking Machines Lab, is expected to be working in this technical area, per a report by [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ex-openai-cto-muratis-startup-plans-compete-openai-others).

The departures of Garg, Li and Patil have also come as part of a larger wave of exits from OpenAI. Some have done so to launch or join recent startups like Murati’s or Periodic Labs, a project focused on material science; Bloomberg [covered](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-05/openai-and-benchmark-are-backing-new-startups-from-ex-openai-staffers) some of this wave, including first word on the Applied Compute trio’s departures, earlier in June.

Others have reportedly taken lucrative offers to join tech giant Meta, which is rebuilding its AI efforts around expensive and splashy new hire Alexandr Wang, the co-founder of Scale AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has [stated publicly](https://www.reuters.com/business/sam-altman-says-meta-offered-100-million-bonuses-openai-employees-2025-06-18/) that some OpenAI staff have received compensation offers as high as $100 million to jump. At least one of those hires, Lucas Beyer, [posted on X](https://x.com/giffmana/status/1938299990922674352?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) that such a number – at least for his small team – was “fake news”.
