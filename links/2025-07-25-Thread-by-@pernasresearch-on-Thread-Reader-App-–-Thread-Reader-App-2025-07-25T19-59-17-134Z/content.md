I turned 40 this year. These are the things I wish I had known at 20.  
  
Starting with...  
  
1\. Develop the ability to add and delete habits. I’ve observed that recovering addicts can have an edge on normal people--they have come to the stark realization that change is existential. Change is the price of survival for all of us. (For me, deleting is easier than adding. You might be different.)

2\. Don’t be too charmed by other people’s financial success. ~8 out of 10 couldn’t even partially replicate it if they had to start over.

3\. Your most original ideas will often be the quietest in your head. Learn to hear and examine even your faintest thoughts--if you think they’re good, write them down immediately.

4\. A lot of what passes as intuition is just fear in disguise. If you’re not self-aware, fear will consistently steer your biggest decisions.

5\. There is a great law of decision-making that nobody told you. Every meaningful decision that you make will carry at least one potential downside.

6\. An idealistic realist beats either an idealist or a realist. A theoretician-practitioner beats either a theoretician or a practitioner.

7\. If you’re naturally strategic do not make the awful mistake of neglecting tactical opportunities. Learn to recognize when you’re standing at the edge of a major moment.

8\. Don’t confuse articulate and well-presenting people with people who are smart. There is an ocean of people out there that have optimized their lives to sound smart, not to be right.

9\. Some of the smartest people I knew stopped growing. Their growth inhibited by alcohol/weed or never quite getting past a core fear.

10\. A life well lived is one lived in defiance. Maybe we are just apes floating through space—but I’ll live with purpose and meaning anyway and I just don’t gaf. h/t Camus

11\. Don’t think of time linearly. Think of it as a series of moments. Most of life you can get by without using too much cognitive load, but in critical moments, you must turn on your full intellect to make the best decision possible--don’t let intuition or emotion take the wheel.

12\. Be very careful when taking advice from others. Even advice from those that love you should be examined (sometimes especially from those that love you--parents will often give highly risk averse advice e.g.).

13\. A lot of adults have gaslighted themselves into thinking they have things all figured out and will talk to you this way.

14\. This goes back to living in defiance: if a goal is worth achieving, and someone offered you the option of pressing a button to acquire it instantly--the right mentality to have is that you would NOT press it.

15\. Strengths and weaknesses are only relevant within a specific context. Your weaknesses and strengths are often connected. They are different sides of the same coin.

16\. Patience is an underrated virtue. Everyone says it’s important, but it’s even far more important than they say. It is your key weapon to help you reduce anxiety and successfully finish things that are hard.

17\. Write down the limiting beliefs you have about yourself. 9 out of 10 times, they’re fiction. The moment you develop the courage to do something you couldn’t foresee, it is a massive life unlock.

18\. If you’re lost or at a low point, it’s a great opportunity to work on character building and self-improvement. Even small steps help.

19\. You have the power to make your life and the lives of those around you better. Live life with agency and have a bias to action.

20\. If you’re naturally analytical, make the painful journey to gain sales skills. And vice versa. Very few people can do both well.

21\. It’s essential to develop the ability to self-motivate outside of social structures. The most important work you’ll do is the work no one sees or cares about.

22\. Don’t become the 40-year-old who’s a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. Our system rewards specialists. At some point you just have to pick something to get very good.

23\. Learn to cross-pollinate lessons from different areas of your life. I once met a scratch golfer who said nothing he learned in golf helped him elsewhere. I was floored.

24\. There’s your opinion of yourself, the opinion others have of you, and your actual objective self. All those can be quite different from each other.

25\. I once heard a guest on @patrick\_oshag say “A good week is when I learn something new. A great week is when I learn that something I believed to be true was wrong.” +1000. Make a lifelong commitment to unlearning.

@patrick\_oshag 26. First impressions can be misleading. They usually tell you about someone’s personality, but character takes longer to tease out.

@patrick\_oshag 27. When pursuing something hard—starting a business, taking a hard class, getting in shape etc.—it’s better to go into it overestimating the difficulty than underestimating it.

@patrick\_oshag 28. Don’t ever assume that people are good at conveying their thoughts and emotions into words. Listening is even harder as it involves more cognitive multi-tasking. None of this comes naturally and requires work and constant effort to get good at.

@patrick\_oshag 29. Sadness distorts truth, which leads to bad thinking, which leads to more sadness. Everything in life is either a positive or negative feedback loop. h/t to former boss and mentor.

@patrick\_oshag 30. My 75 y/o Dad says that the key to life is keeping your morale up and the formula to do that is different for each of us. (notice he said morale not happiness)

@patrick\_oshag 31. Never link your self-worth to outcomes. Good decisions can still lead to bad results---most variables are outside your control. And even if the decisions weren’t great, cut yourself some slack.

@patrick\_oshag 32. If you don’t identify as someone who reads a lot, move heaven and earth to change this.

@patrick\_oshag 33. People by and large become what they think about themselves. h/t Bob Rotella

@patrick\_oshag 33. The most important approval is the one you get from yourself. Maintaining high levels of self-approval is like walking through life with body armor.

Poker & Investing  
  
Having spent an inordinate amount of time in both realms, I feel qualified to comment on the lessons I’ve learned in poker that are massively helpful in investing.  
  
Would really appreciate a retweet, especially if you have poker players following you.  
  
Huge thanks to my poker pro friend Jacob Miller for reviewing this. (1/n)

Losses hurt more than gains. Even winning poker players, by and large, don’t feel lucky. How can this be? Because humans feel losses much more strongly than commensurate gains. Once you understand this at a deep level, things get slightly easier.

Adapting your style to the field. In poker, the most optimal style is often the one that runs counter to what everyone else is doing.
